      Though this form of skin typing won’t help you find your perfect shade, it can tell you just how much shade you
      should get on sunny days.
      <br><br>
      This classification is semi-subjective, as it was developed by interviewing people about their past sun reactions.
      After picking out distinct trends, the creator identified six groups.
      <br><br>
      It’s possible that you won’t meet all of the characteristics of any one type, so you should go with the one that
      best describes you.

        In order to achieve the best protection effect, when the ultraviolet radiation level is 3 or above, we
        recommend combining some protection measures:</p>
      <ul class="content-text-item">
        <li>
          Put on some sun-protective clothes – cover the skin as much as possible<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Apply on broad spectrum, waterproof SPF30 + sunscreen. Wear it 20 minutes before you go out, then every two
          hours. Sunscreen should not be used to extend your time in the sun.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Wear a hat to protect your face, head, neck and ears<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Looking for shadows<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Wear Sunglasses – Make sure they meet Australian standards.<br><br>
        </li>
      </ul>
