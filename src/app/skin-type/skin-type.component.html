    <p class="content-text">
        Did you know that there are different skin types and each of them has a different reaction to the sun. 
        You can't tell what skin type you are by just looking at your own skin. 
        Therefore, we'll be using a skin typing technique developed by Fitzpatrick called "Fitzpatrick skin typing". 
        In short, this guy scientifically classify skins into different types based on the skin reactions to the sun. 
        <br><br>
        Below is a simple quiz to determine your skin type. 
        Just answer these simple questions and you will know your skin type in a matter of seconds.
